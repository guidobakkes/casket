Casket
======
A light framework to build upon.

Welcome to Casket. A highly customizable and responsive framework. 
Rather than a full UI framework, Casket can be used as a quick way to set up your next website. 
By including Normalize.css, ionicons, some basic styling and a highly customizable and responsive 
template design, you will be up and running in no time!
